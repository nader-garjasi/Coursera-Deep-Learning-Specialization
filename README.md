Programming Assignments
Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
The first course in the Deep Learning Specialization focuses on the foundational concepts of neural networks and deep learning.

Learn about the key technology trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to applications.

Week 2 - A1: Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
Week 3 - A1: Planar data classification with one hidden layer
Week 4 - A1: Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step
Week 4 - A2: Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application
Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
The second course in the Deep Learning Specialization focuses on opening the black box of deep learning to understand the processes that drive performance and systematically generate good results.

Learn best practices for training and developing test sets and analyzing bias/variance for building deep learning applications; be able to use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking; implement and apply various optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop, and Adam, and check for their convergence; and implement a neural network in TensorFlow.

Week 1 - A1: Initialization
Week 1 - A2: Regularization
Week 1 - A3: Gradient Checking
Week 2 - A1: Optimization Methods
Week 3 - A1: TensorFlow Tutorial
Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
The third course in the Deep Learning Specialization focuses on learning how to build a successful machine learning project and practicing decision making as a machine learning project leader.

Learn how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system; prioritize strategies to reduce errors; understand complex ML settings such as mismatched training/test sets and comparing to and/or outperforming human performance; and apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

This is also a standalone course for learners who have basic knowledge of machine learning. This course draws on Andrew Ng's experience building and shipping many deep learning products. If you aspire to become a technical leader who can set the direction for an AI team, this course provides the "industry experience" that you might otherwise only get after years of ML work experience.

There are no programming assignments for this course.
